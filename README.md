# Customer Rewards System

## ⭐ Project Description

The *Customer Rewards System* is a Spring Boot application that calculates and manages reward points earned by customers based on their monthly transactions. The system provides REST APIs to create customers, record transactions, and fetch detailed reward summaries.

Rewards are calculated using the following rules:

* $0 – $50 → 0 points
* $50 – $100 → 1 point per dollar above $50
* Above $100 → 2 points per dollar above $100 + 50 points for the previous tier

The application uses an *H2 in-memory database* for easy testing and Postman can be used for API testing.

## ⚡ Reward Calculation Logic

`java
public static int calculatePoints(double amount) {
    int points = 0;
    if (amount > 100) {
        points += (int) ((amount - 100) * 2);
        points += 50;
    } else if (amount > 50) {
        points += (int) (amount - 50);
    }
    return points;
}


---

## 🧪 Testing

* Controller Tests : `CustomerRewardControllerTest`, `TransactionControllerTest`
* Service Tests    : `CustomerRewardServiceTest`, `TransactionServiceTest`
* Repository Tests : `CustomerRewardRepositoryTest`, `TransactionRepositoryTest`

All tests use JUnit5, Mockito, and Spring Boot Test with H2 in-memory database.
